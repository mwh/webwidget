webwidget - display a web page like a desktop widget

webwidget loads a URL into a specialised WebKit browser and displays it
in a small window without borders, like a desktop widget. Optionally, it
can display the occluded part of the desktop background image in the
background of the page, for a pseudo-transparent appearance.

In its simplest form, webwidget takes a single argument which is used as
the URL to load. The default size for the widget is 250x120. Other
options allow customising the display:
  --height H
  --width W
    Set the height or width of the widget to the given number of pixels.
  --decorate
    Show the window manager decorations (which are usually hidden).
  --desktop-background PATH
    Use PATH as the desktop background image. This image must be the
    same size as the desktop. The widget will display the part of the
    image behind itself in the background of the web page when this
    option is specified. If the widget window is moved, the background
    image will update. If the image itself changes it will be reloaded
    within a few seconds.

Consult your window manager documentation for information on how to
position the widget, both automatically at startup and while running.
Alt-drag is a common way to move undecorated windows.
